## React Poke Battle

This Web App was made to learn the basic functionality of React Hooks and can be found live [here](https://sesouk.github.io/react_poke_battle/)

## Design
This game was designed to be played on mobile but is fully responsive utilizing CSS Grid.

## How to Play
The game is a spin on the game "Rock, Paper, Scissors" except with Generation 2 Pokemon starters. You choose your desired Pokemon and click battle and repeat the process until five rounds are played and a winner is decided. Once five rounds are played you can restart the battle. If you try to start the battle without picking a Pokemon you will be asked to restart the battle and choose a Pokemon.
